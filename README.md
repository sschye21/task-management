## Getting started

There are 2 ways to start the project out-of-the-box: [development server](#development-server) or [Docker Compose](#docker-compose). Please note that, for the purposes of the assessment, the final solution **_must_** work as intended via Docker Compose.

### Development server

#### Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) _(see [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) for version number)_
- [Yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

#### Installing and running

Open a command line of your preference and do the following:

1. Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.

2. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server.

3. Wait for a console message saying the app is ready, open the browser of your preference and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

### Docker Compose

#### Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) _(see [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) for version number)_
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/): more convenient as it bundles Docker Compose as well

#### Installing and running

1. Duplicate `.env.sample` in the root folder, name it `.env` and configure all the empty `DB_POSTGRES_*` variables.

2. Run `docker compose up` on a terminal of your choice.

3. Wait for a console message saying the app is ready, open the browser of your preference and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

4. Run `docker compose down` on a separate terminal whenever you want to stop the services.

## Database configuration

The challenge assumes you will be storing and retrieving tasks from a database. The project contains an initial configuration for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) to speed things up but you might pick your system of choice if you prefer. Either way, as mentioned before, the application should work as expected when running Docker Compose.
In case you are not using an ORM to manage and connect to the database and are sticking to the project's setup, you should populate the `init.sql` schema creation script at the root. It is run automatically as part of `docker compose up` the first time it gets executed to create your table(s).
